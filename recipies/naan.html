    <h3 class="headings" >Description:</h3>
    <p class="text">Naan bread is a type of leavened, oven-baked flatbread that originated in South Asia, particularly within Indian cuisine. <br> Known for its soft, chewy texture and slightly crispy exterior, naan is typically made from a simple dough consisting of flour, yeast, water, yogurt, and a bit of oil or ghee (clarified butter). <br> The dough is traditionally left to rise, rolled out, and then cooked in a tandoor, which is a clay oven, giving the bread its distinctive charred spots and smoky flavor.</p>
